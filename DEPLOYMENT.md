### Step 2: Create Codespace
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **green "Code" button**
3. Click **"Codespaces" tab**
4. Click **"Create codespace on main"**

### Step 3: Auto-Setup
Codespace will automatically:
- Install Node.js 20+
- Run `npm install`
- Forward ports
- Set up development environment

### Step 4: Build and Start
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Step 5: Access Game
- Codespace will show a popup when server starts
- Click **"Open in Browser"**
- Share the public URL with others!

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

### Add Custom Domain to Railway
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"Settings" → "Domains"**
3. Add your custom domain (e.g., `astrology.online`)
4. Follow Railway's DNS instructions

### Popular Domain Options
- `astrology.online` ⭐ **Recommended!**
- `zodiac.app`
- `starreading.co`
- `mysigns.app`

## 🔧 Project Configuration

### Build Process
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --config webpack.config.mjs",
    "start": "http-server dist -p ${PORT:-8080}"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Webpack Production Config
The app automatically uses production settings:
- Minified JavaScript/CSS
- Optimized images and fonts
- Browser routing support
- Asset hashing for caching

## 📱 Features Available After Deployment

### 🔮 Zodiac Signs
- Individual sign pages: `/signs/aries`, `/signs/leo`, etc.
- Complete sign descriptions
- Compatibility information
- Element and ruling planet details

### 🌟 Responsive Design
- **Mobile-optimized** for phone users
- **Tablet-friendly** layouts
- **Desktop** full experience
- **Cross-browser** compatibility

### ⚡ Performance
- Fast loading with Webpack optimization
- Browser routing (no hash URLs)
- Cached assets for repeat visits
- Progressive loading

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build locally first
npm run build

# Common issues:
# - Missing dependencies: npm install
# - TypeScript errors: Check console output
# - Asset path issues: Verify webpack config
```

### Railway Deployment Issues
1. **Build failing**: Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. **App not starting**: Verify `start` script in package.json
3. **Assets not loading**: Check webpack `publicPath` configuration
4. **Port binding**: Railway automatically sets PORT env variable

### Asset Loading Problems
If CSS/JS files don't load:
1. Verify webpack `publicPath` is set to `'/'`
2. Check that `index.html` references are correct
3. Ensure `http-server` serves from `dist` folder

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

### Railway Auto-Deploy
- Every `git push` to main branch automatically deploys
- Build logs visible in Railway dashboard
- Rollback available if deployment fails
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes locally
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run build
npm start

# Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Add new zodiac features"
git push origin main
# Railway automatically deploys!
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- **Deployment logs**: See build and start process
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, request volume
- **Domain management**: Custom domains and SSL
- **Environment variables**: Manage app configuration

### Usage Analytics
```bash
# Add analytics to track usage (optional)
# Google Analytics, Plausible, or similar
```

## 💰 Cost Management

### Railway Pricing
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month + usage
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month + usage  
- **Includes**: 500GB bandwidth, custom domains, team collaboration

### Optimization Tips
1. **Optimize bundle size**: Remove unused dependencies
2. **Enable compression**: Webpack already configured
3. **Cache static assets**: Use CDN for images/fonts
4. **Monitor usage**: Railway dashboard shows resource usage
